                <p>A travel agent takes all of the headache out of planning a trip and handles virtually all aspects of your travel, at absolutely no cost to you. The combined experience of the team and the feedback.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="pannel">
                <p>No, there is no fee for our vacation planning services as the travel vendors involved recognize our value and compensate us from the gross amount paid (what you would have paid even without our assistance). For those complicated international itineraries that require custom crafting and significant involvement of our international on-location partners, we do request an intent-to-travel deposit to begin the process. This deposit is applied to the reservations that are made on your behalf.</p>

                <span>DO I NEED TRAVEL INSURANCE?</span>
                <i class="fa solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
            </button>
            <div class="pannel">
                <p>Travel insurance is available and recommended to protect your travel investment. Many trips, such as tours and cruises, involve non-refundable funds paid months in advance. Travel insurance protects you from losing this investment. Perhaps even more important is the ‘during travel’ coverage and assistance that comes with the top-flight insurance companies we carry.</p>
